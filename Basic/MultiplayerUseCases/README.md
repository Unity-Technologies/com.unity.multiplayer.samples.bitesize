This sample provides a series of scenes. Each scene explains a specific API or system commonly used in Netcode for GameObjects. In this sample you will learn more about client-server communication, state synchronization, and other typical mechanics of multiplayer games.

## Sample overview

Making a multiplayer game is different than making a singleplayer one. 

Understanding how to send data and events over the network and to the right players is a challenge.

Multiplayer Use Cases' goal is to show you how to perform common actions in a multiplayer environment, so that you can build the features of your game with them in mind.

In this sample you'll learn about the core features of Netcode For GameObjects (Netcode) through practical examples that you'll be able to extend and adapt to fit the gameplay logic of your own game. 

Each scene comes with an in-editor tutorial that will help you explore the main scripts and object of each scene, so you know where to look at to find what you're looking for.

## Exploring the Sample
When you open the Sample for the first time, a popup will ask you if you want to be guided. If you choose to be not, the Sample will automatically open the SelectionScreen scene. From there, you can explore the different Scenes by your own.
