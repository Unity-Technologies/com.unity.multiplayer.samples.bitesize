      networked 2D and physics-based character movement. This sample leverages Netcode
      for GameObject''s (Netcode) NetworkRigidbody2D component and also showcases
      object pooling. Read more about the sample from the '

    text: The entry scene for this game is the network scene. From there a game can
      be hosted or an existing game can be joined. Control the ship using WASD and
      shoot asteroids (or other players!) using the spacebar. Fly over pickups in
      the scene to get different temporary buffs for your ship (like increased fly
      speed or shooting extra bullets).
