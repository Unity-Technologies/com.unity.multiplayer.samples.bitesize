This is a UNet sample project converted to Netcode for GameObjects. The Invaders sample is a sample project designed to demonstrate game flows and game modes.
<br><br>

# Sample Overview

In this sample, learn more about:

- Simple start, lobby, and finish flow with Netcode for GameObjects using Scene Management
- Unconventional movement networked
- Client driven movement with Client Network Transform
- Shared timer between clients in a client-sided predicted way
<br><br>

## Exploring the Sample
The entry scene for this game is the InitBootStrap scene. From there a game can be hosted or an existing game can be joined. Move back and forth using the A and D keys, and shoot using the spacebar. Shoot enemies to gain points, and avoid their bullets to avoid losing health (and eventually losing)!
