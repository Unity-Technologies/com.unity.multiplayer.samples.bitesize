    text: 'The ClientDriven sample is a sample project designed to demonstrate responsive
      3rd-person WASD character movements even under unfavourable network conditions.
      It also showcases how to interact with shared physics objects in a scene. The
      sample leverages Netcode for GameObject''s (Netcode) ClientNetworkTransform
      component and moves the owning player client-side, client authoritatively.
      Read more about the sample from the '
    linkText: ClientDriven bitesize sample documentation.

  - heading: 
    text: The entry scene for this game is the Bootstrap scene. From there a game
      can be hosted or an existing game can be joined. Run around the scene using
      WASD, and pick up orbs using the spacebar. Convert orbs from one color to another
      by dropping them in the converters in the middle of the level. Deposit orbs
      into the drop spots of the same color to earn points.
