# ‼️ Experimental Samples! Use at your own risk ‼️

The Experimental folder is to collect and share ideas and small projects among the Unity Multiplayer community. These samples are not guaranteed to follow Unity's recommended practices. They are specifically for fostering discussion and little quality guarantee; they are not for production use.

These code samples may become full Bitesize samples or may be removed they are no longer promoting good, up-to-date practices.

Be critical when looking at these samples and use at your own risk.

For education on game features critical to your production, don't use these samples and stick to our regular samples and docs (such as [Boss Room](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/learn/bossroom/bossroom/#boss-room-overview) and official [Bitesize](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/learn/bitesize/bitesize-introduction/) samples).

## Process to contribute

1. Create a new pull request against `main`.
1. The samples team will review it quickly for any major blockers and publish it. There will be no release announcements.
1. The samples team will merge it back to `develop` afterward.

### Content requirements:

If any of the following is not adhered, your PR will be rejected.

- No secret or patentable content. This repo is public.
- No copyrighted material or 3rd parties.
- To help us and users track your samples over time, we require a small paragraph in the **PR description** and in a **readme.md** at the root of the content including:
  - A small description.
  - Why this is interesting to users, and what you expect them to get out of this content.

## What this isn’t
- This isn’t to replace `testprojects`. The goal is to share education and usage samples with users fast, not create test beds for internal SDK development.
- This isn’t to replace `bitesize` or in-package samples. Samples in `Experimental` are transient. They’ll either be destroyed or promoted to a real Bitesize.
