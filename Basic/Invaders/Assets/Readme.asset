  title: 'Invaders: A Bitesize Sample'
  sections:
  - heading: Invaders
    text: The Invaders sample is a sample project designed to demonstrate game flow
      and modes with Netcode for GameObjects (Netcode) using Scene Managerment, unconventional
      networked movement, and a shared timer between clients updated client-side
      with server-side seeding. Read more about the sample from the
    linkText: Invaders bitesize sample documentation page.

  - heading: 
    text: The entry scene for this game is the InitBootStrap scene. From there a
      game can be hosted or an existing game can be joined. Move back and forth using
      the A and D keys, and shoot using the spacebar. Shoot enemies to gain points,
      and avoid their bullets to avoid losing health (and eventually losing)!
