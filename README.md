<br><br>

This repository contains a collection of bitesize sample projects and games that showcase different techniques
which can help you get started with development of a multiplayer 
project using [Netcode for GameObjects](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects).

# Bitesize Samples Overview

### 2D Space Shooter Overview

The [2D Space Shooter Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/2DSpaceShooter) was a UNET sample that has been converted over to NGO. Check it out to learn more about physics movement and status effects using Netcode `NetworkVariables` and `ObjectPooling`.
<br><br>

### Invaders Overview

The [Invaders Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/Invaders) was a UNET sample that has been converted over to NGO. Learn more about game flow, modes, unconventional networked movement, and using a shared timer in this sample.
<br><br>

### Client Driven Overview
See the [Client Driven Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/ClientDriven) to learn about client driven movements, networked physics, spawning vs in-scene placed `NetworkObjects`, and `NetworkObject` parenting.
<br><br>

### Dynamic Addressables Network Prefabs Overview

Check out the new [Dynamic Addressables Network Prefabs Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/DynamicAddressablesNetworkPrefabs) to learn more about the dynamic prefab system, which allows us to add new spawnable network prefabs at runtime.
