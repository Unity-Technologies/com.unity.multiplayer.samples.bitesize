  title: 'Dynamic Prefabs: A Bitesize Sample'
  sections:
  - heading: Dynamic Prefabs
    text: 'The Dynamic Prefabs sample showcases the available use-cases for the dynamic
      prefab system, which allows us to add new spawnable prefabs in runtime. Each
      scene in the project showcases a different, isolated feature of the API, allowing
      for easy extraction into other projects. This sample also uses in-game UI (created
      using UI Toolkit) to interface with the dynamic prefabs system with configurable
      options like artificial latency and network spawn timeout for easy testing.
      Read more about the sample from the '
    linkText: Dynamic Prefabs bitesize sample documentation.
