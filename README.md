# Bitesize Samples Overview

### 2D Space Shooter Overview

The [2D Space Shooter Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/2DSpaceShooter) was a UNet sample that has been converted over to NGO. Check it out to learn more about physics movement and status effects using Netcode `NetworkVariables` and `ObjectPooling`.
<br><br>

### Invaders Overview

The [Invaders Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/Invaders) was a UNet sample that has been converted over to NGO. Learn more about game flow, modes, unconventional networked movement, and using a shared timer in this sample.
<br><br>

### Client Driven Overview
See the [Client Driven Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/ClientDriven) to learn about client driven movements, networked physics, spawning vs in-scene placed `NetworkObjects`, and `NetworkObject` parenting.
<br><br>

### Dynamic Addressables Network Prefabs Overview ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/New!-brightgreen)

Check out the new [Dynamic Addressables Network Prefabs Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/DynamicAddressablesNetworkPrefabs) to learn more about the dynamic prefab system, which allows us to add new spawnable network prefabs at runtime.
