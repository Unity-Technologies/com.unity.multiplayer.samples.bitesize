# ‼️Deprecated Samples‼️

Deprecated samples are samples no longer maintained and supported by Unity because they are obsolete, address currently unsupported use cases, or rely on deprecated technologies.

Deprecated samples will not be updated, nor support will be provided. However they can still be useful as a point of reference if you're using an old version of the Unity Engine or deprecated workflows.

## Goal and Purpose

The goal of this folder is to aggregate samples that are no longer supported, but that can still be useful. They are made available as a point of reference for old workflows. 

**These samples come with no maintenance guarantee and are _not_ recommended for production use.**

This means:
- They are unsupported and may be changed or removed at any time. 
- They are not rigorously tested against the latest Unity Editor version, platforms, or devices.
- They are not maintained to the same quality or standards as those labelled as _Production-Ready_.
- They may address unsupported use cases.

For education on game features critical to your production, please use our **Production-Ready** [Bitesize samples](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/learn/bitesize/bitesize-introduction/), [Boss Room](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/learn/bossroom/bossroom/), and [documentation](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/).
