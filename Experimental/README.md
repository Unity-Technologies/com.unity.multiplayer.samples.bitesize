# ‼️ Experimental Samples‼️

Experimental samples are new samples or experimental modifications made to mature samples. Unity does not support Experimental samples because they are in the early stages of development, address currently unsupported use cases or rely on experimental technologies.

Experimental samples can go through many changes before they are ready to be released and labelled as Production-Ready. At some point in the future, they might pass the verification requirements; however, they might also be deprecated instead. Because there is no guarantee for future support, you should not use experimental samples in production.

## Goal and Purpose

The goal of this folder is to aggregate ideas and small projects in development to accelerate community access. They are made available to foster discussion and gauge interest in particular areas. 

**These samples come with no quality guarantee and are _not_ recommended for production use.**

This means:
- They are unsupported and may be changed or removed at any time. 
- They are not rigorously tested against editor versions, platforms or devices.
- They are not maintained to the same quality or standards as those labelled as Production-Ready.
- They may address unsupported use cases.

If you are looking for education on game features critical to your production, please use our **'Production-Ready'** [samples](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/learn/bitesize/bitesize-introduction/) and [documentation](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/).
