## Exploring the Sample
The entry scene for this game is the InitBootStrap scene. From there a game can be hosted or an existing game can be joined. Move back and forth using the A and D keys, and shoot using the spacebar. Shoot enemies to gain points, and avoid their bullets to avoid losing health (and eventually losing)!
